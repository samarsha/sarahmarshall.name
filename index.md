Hello! I'm Sarah Marshall, a senior studying computer science at the University
of Washington. My interests include software engineering, design and
implementation of programming languages, automated software verification and
synthesis, and quantum computing.

This is my personal website and blog where I may occasionally write about topics
that interest me or projects that I've been involved with.
