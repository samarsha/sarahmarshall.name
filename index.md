Hello!
I'm Sarah Marshall, a software engineer at [Microsoft Quantum][msquantum].
I work on the compiler and runtime for Q#, a quantum programming language.
Before that, I studied computer science at the University of Washington.

I like languages, whether they are computer languages or human languages.

These days, I am into functional programming---my favorite languages are [Haskell], [F#][fsharp], and [Scala].
As a school project, I co-created [KnitScript], a domain-specific programming language for composing knitting patterns.

I'm really interested in constructed human languages like [Esperanto] and [Lojban] and how they affect the ways in which ideas can be communicated.
In my spare time, I'm learning German.

This is my personal website and blog where sometimes I might write about cool things I find or projects that I've been involved with.
