Hello! I'm Sarah Marshall, a senior studying computer science at the University
of Washington. Some of my interests are software engineering, programming
languages, and quantum computing. I also have two cats! 🐈🐈

This is my personal website and blog where sometimes I might write about cool
things I find or projects that I've been involved with.
